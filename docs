A NOTE ON LOAD BALANCER
A layer 4 load balancer is a device that manages traffic at the transport layer of the OSI model by routing it based on network information, such as IP addresses and port numbers. 
Layer 4 load balancers are often hardware devices that run proprietary software. They work by:
Network Address Translation (NAT)
Changing the destination IP address from the load balancer's to the content server's
Changing the source address
Changing the source address recorded in the packet header from the server's IP address to the load balancer's 
Layer 4 load balancers are effective for simple load balancing because they can forward messages quickly, efficiently, and securely without inspecting or decrypting them. However, they can't make content-based decisions, so they rely on simple algorithms like round-robin routing. 
Layer 4 load balancers are ideal for applications that need session persistence or stateful communication. 


Loadbalancer takes an request 

Server1 is located on http://localhost:4444
Server2 is located on http://localhost:4445

Our load balancer (reverse proxy) is located on http://localhost:3000


request come to http://localhost:3000
forwards the request to Server1 or Server2
get the result
